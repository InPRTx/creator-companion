## Download It
The Creator Companion is available [on the VRChat website](https://vrchat.com/home/download). You can always [download the latest version directly](https://vrchat.com/download/vcc).

## Installer
The Creator Companion will be installed into your "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs" folder by default (e.g. `C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs`). You can change this during installation if you like. You can delete the installer once the installation is complete.

## Requirements
- Unity Hub and Unity must be installed.
    - When you launch the Creator Companion, it checks whether Unity and Unity Hub are installed. If not, it shows you how to install them.
    - If you follow these instructions, you will get the latest version of the Unity Hub and a [version of Unity compatible with the VRChat SDK](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/upgrade/current-unity-version).
- The Creator Companion supports Windows 10 and 11 (64-bit).
    - The [CLI has some functionality on Mac and Linux](vpm/cli#mac-and-linux-support).
    - Other operating systems are not fully supported.
- To upload worlds and avatars, you must create an account on the [VRChat webite](https://vrchat.com/home/).

### Unity Editor Versions
The Creator Companion automatically installs VRChat's [currently supported Unity version](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/upgrade/current-unity-version). If you already installed the correct version, the Creator Companion finds it automatically.
